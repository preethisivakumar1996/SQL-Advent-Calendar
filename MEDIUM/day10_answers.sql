-- Write a query to calculate the following for each friend: 
-- 1. number of resolutions they made, 
-- 2. number of resolutions they completed, and 
-- 3. success percentage (% of resolutions completed) and 
-- 4. a success category based on the success percentage:
-- Green: If success percentage is greater than 75%.
-- Yellow: If success percentage is between 50% and 75% (inclusive).
-- Red: If success percentage is less than 50%.SELECT friend_name,
